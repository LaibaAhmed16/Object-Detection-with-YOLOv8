| Platform       | Recommended Model | GPU Support | Notes                           |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| CPU-only PC/Laptop | yolov8n.pt        | ❌          | Works fine (~10–15 FPS, lightweight) |
| Desktop w/ GPU | yolov8s.pt        | ✅ CUDA     | Best performance, smoother detection |
| Jetson Nano    | yolov8n.pt        | ✅ CUDA     | Can achieve near real-time performance |
| Raspberry Pi   | yolov8n (exported to NCNN) | ❌ CPU only  | Limited FPS, not ideal for heavy tasks |

> ⚡ Default model in this project: **`yolov8n.pt`** (fastest & most efficient for general use).  
Performance depends on hardware, model size, and video resolution.
